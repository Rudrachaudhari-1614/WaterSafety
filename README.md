This study introduces a novel method for monitoring water quality using combined Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Our approach recognizes the vital im- portance of water for life and habitats, incorporating a variety of AI algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and perceptron. The use of these algorithms provides an invaluable opportunity for an in-depth study of water quality data and detection of deviant values, as well as forecasting and prevention of threats. This paper looks at these dynamics, presenting a new paradigm; we employed AI-infused techniques to unveil hidden patterns in data while using blockchain technology as a means for securing data transactions. For training the AI algorithms, we utilized a benchmark dataset of smart water treatment plants that comprised of malicious and non-malicious sensor data. The trained AI models can efficiently bifurcate malicious and non-malicious sensor data so that treatment plants can operate effectively. Further, the non-malicious data is forwarded to the blockchain network, where different water-related organizations are associated with water quality checking, improving human life expectancy. Lastly, the proposed architecture is evaluated using different evaluation metrics, such as training accuracy, log-loss curve, validation curve, and blockchain bandwidth graph
